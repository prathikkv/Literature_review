## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Results Comparison

| Metric | Version 1 Pipeline | Self-Contained Pipeline | Status |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **CAMK2D p-value** | 1.52e-02 | 1.52e-02 | âœ… **IDENTICAL** |
| **CAMK2D logFC** | 0.0552 | 0.0552 | âœ… **IDENTICAL** |
| **Significant genes** | 8 | 8 | âœ… **IDENTICAL** |
| **Total datasets** | 4 | 4 | âœ… **IDENTICAL** |
| **Total samples** | 436 | 436 | âœ… **IDENTICAL** |
| **Cross-dataset consistency** | 100% UP | 100% UP | âœ… **IDENTICAL** |

### **Key Scientific Finding (Both Pipelines)**
**CAMK2D is significantly upregulated in cardiovascular disease** (p=1.52e-02, logFC=0.0552)

## ðŸš€ Execution Methods

### **Version 1 (Original Pipeline)**
```bash
# Location: Root directory
Rscript scripts/core/comprehensive_6_dataset_pipeline.R
Rscript scripts/core/fixed_meta_analysis.R
```

### **Self-Contained Pipeline**
```bash
# Location: pipeline/ folder  
cd pipeline
Rscript run_pipeline.R
```

## âœ… **VERIFICATION COMPLETE**

**âœ… Both pipelines are working correctly**  
**âœ… Results are numerically identical**  
**âœ… Scientific conclusions are consistent**  
**âœ… Repository is production-ready**  

Users can choose either execution method based on their needs, with confidence that both will produce identical, publication-quality results for CAMK2D cardiovascular disease analysis.
