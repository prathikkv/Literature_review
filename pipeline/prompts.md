# Claude Code Prompts for Dynamic Pharmaceutical Pipeline

## üéØ PROMPT 1: Dynamic Dataset Download System
**Goal**: Auto-download new GEO datasets when added to YAML

```
I have an existing R pipeline for microarray analysis. I need to enhance it to automatically download GEO datasets that aren't cached.

CURRENT STRUCTURE:
- config.yml contains dataset IDs
- cache/ directory stores processed datasets  
- Uses GEOquery for data download
- Current datasets: GSE57338, GSE41177, GSE79768, GSE115574

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create function `auto_download_geo_datasets()` that:
   - Reads dataset list from config.yml
   - Checks if datasets exist in cache/
   - Downloads missing datasets using GEOquery
   - Handles GPL platform detection automatically
   - Validates download integrity
   - Saves in standardized format (.rds)
   - Updates download log

2. Error handling for:
   - Network failures
   - Invalid GSE IDs
   - Platform mismatches
   - Corrupted downloads

3. Integration with existing pipeline without breaking current functionality

Please provide the complete function with proper logging and validation.
