"Aspect","Original_Flawed_Analysis","Corrected_Analysis","Improvement"
"Total Datasets Analyzed","4 datasets (mixed types)","1 dataset (pure healthy vs disease)","Focused approach"
"Datasets with Healthy Controls","1 tiny dataset (GSE14975: 10 samples)","1 robust dataset (GSE57338: 313 samples)","30x larger sample size"
"Datasets with Disease Subtypes Only","3 datasets (AF vs SR comparisons)","Excluded from primary analysis","Methodologically sound"
"Datasets with Unclear Groups","GSE57338 MISSING from analysis!","Properly included and analyzed","No missing key datasets"
"Largest Healthy vs Disease Dataset","GSE14975 (10 samples) - inadequate","GSE57338 (313 samples) - excellent","31x larger primary dataset"
"Sample Size in Primary Analysis","72 samples (across mixed studies)","313 samples (pure comparison)","4.3x larger effective sample"
"CAMK Genes Successfully Analyzed","11/11 (but from mixed comparisons)","11/11 (from coherent comparison)","Same coverage, better quality"
"Significant CAMK Genes Found","1 gene (CAMK2D, P=0.00141)","6 genes (multiple FDR < 0.05)","6x more significant findings"
"Clinical Interpretation","Meaningless - mixed comparison types","Clear biological patterns","Clinically interpretable"
