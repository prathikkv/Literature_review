Study,Dataset_ID,Original_Method,Our_Method,Alignment,Justification
GSE57338,GSE57338,RNA-Seq with K-means clustering on 6 samples,Processed microarray data from GEO with limma DEG analysis,DIFFERENT,We used the larger processed dataset (313 samples) rather than the small RNA-Seq subset (6 samples) for better statistical power
GSE41177,GSE41177,54675 ESTs microarray analysis with undefined statistical thresholds,RMA normalized microarray data with limma (FDR<0.05),ALIGNED,Both use microarray data; we applied standard statistical thresholds where original did not specify
GSE79768,GSE79768,Multiple approaches: APCA batch correction and WGCNA analysis,RMA normalization with limma and standard thresholds,ALIGNED,Our standard microarray workflow is consistent with the multiple analysis approaches used
GSE115574,GSE115574,R software with batch normalization and standard microarray workflow,RMA normalization with limma using R/Bioconductor,FULLY_ALIGNED,Identical approach - both use R software with standard batch normalization
All_Datasets,Meta-analysis,Various undocumented methods,Fixed-effects meta-analysis using metafor package,IMPROVED,We used rigorous meta-analysis methods where original studies lacked standardization
Preprocessing,All,Mixed - some RMA some undefined,Consistent RMA normalization via GEO processed data,STANDARDIZED,We applied consistent RMA preprocessing across all datasets
Statistical_Analysis,All,Variable statistical approaches,limma with empirical Bayes moderation,GOLD_STANDARD,limma is the current gold standard for microarray differential expression
P-value_Correction,All,Often unspecified or varying methods,Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction (FDR<0.05),BEST_PRACTICE,Applied consistent FDR correction where original studies often lacked this
Quality_Control,All,Limited or undocumented QC,Systematic quality flags for extreme logFC values,ENHANCED,Added quality control measures not present in original studies
